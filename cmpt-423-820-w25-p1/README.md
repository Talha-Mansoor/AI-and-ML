# Mini Project 1: Tensor Arithmetic

In this Mini Project you will implement a k nearest neighbour classifier using low-level numpy routines.
The learning objective is to learn and practice how to implement machine learning algorithms in Python.

## Installation

This project is created with Python 3.12. 
As usual, you can create a python environment with that version and install all dependencies with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File structure

For completing this project you only need to edit the existing files.
Please do not create additional files and add them into the repository.

The files included in this project are the following:

```
├── IrisKNN.ipynb          # Jupyter notebook. You need to edit this.
├── README.md
├── p1
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── iris_knn.py        # Module with kNN implementation. You need to edit this.
├── data
│   └── iris.json          # Dataset file used for this assignment.
├── requirements.txt       # Python requirements.
└── test
    └── test_iris_knn.py   # Unit tests for testing the kNN implementation. You do not need to edit this but can add your own additional unit tests.
```

## Completing this project

Follow the instructions in the `Iris_KNN.ipynb` notebook.
To complete this project, you only need to edit files `p1/iris_knn.py` and `IrisKNN.ipynb`.
